# Breakout Game – Interactive Version

A personal reinterpretation of the classic Breakout game, focused on experimenting with alternative interaction methods beyond keyboard input.

## 🎮 Concept
This project explores different ways of controlling a game in the browser, allowing the player to choose between physical and camera-based interaction.

## 🕹️ Interaction Modes
**Arduino Controller**  
* Custom-built physical controller created by me.  
* Requires Arduino connection to function properly.

**Hand Detection (ml5.js)**  
* Camera-based hand detection using ml5.js.  
* Requires camera permissions to be enabled.

The interaction mode can be selected in the initial menu.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- p5.js
- ml5.js
- Arduino

## 🧠 What I focused on
- Game logic and collision mechanics
- Integrating hardware interaction into a web-based game
- Camera-based interaction using machine learning libraries
- Handling input errors and device availability

## ⚠️ Notes
- Arduino mode will not function if the device is not detected
- Hand detection requires camera access

## 📅 Context
Experimental project developed as part of my academic work.
